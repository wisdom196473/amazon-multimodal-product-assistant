# Amazon E-commerce Visual Assistant

A multimodal AI assistant leveraging the Amazon Product Dataset 2020 to provide comprehensive product search and recommendations through natural language and image-based interactions[1].

## Project Overview

This conversational AI system combines advanced language and vision models to enhance e-commerce customer support, enabling accurate, context-aware responses to product-related queries[1].

## Project Structure

- `amazon_app.py`: Main Streamlit application
- `model.py`: Core AI model implementations
- `Vision_AI.ipynb`: EDA, Embedding Model, LLM
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wisdom196473/amazon-multimodal-product-assistant.git
cd amazon-multimodal-product-assistant
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run amazon_app.py
```

## Technical Architecture

### Data Processing & Storage
- Standardized text fields and normalized numeric attributes
- Enhanced metadata indices for categories, price ranges, keywords, brands
- Validated image quality and managed duplicates
- Structured data storage in Parquet format[1]

### Model Components
